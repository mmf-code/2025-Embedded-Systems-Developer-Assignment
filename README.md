# 2025-Embedded-Systems-Developer-Assignment
This project is part of the Borda Academy 2025 Embedded Systems Developer Assignment. It demonstrates an environmental monitoring system using multiple IÂ²C sensors on a Raspberry Pi 5. The system periodically collects environmental data, applies filtering, performs statistical analysis, and advertises results over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
